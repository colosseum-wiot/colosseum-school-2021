## Invited Speakers - Day 2


* **Speaker:** Geoffrey Mainland, Associate Professor of CCI at Drexel University
* **Title:** Using DragonRadio in the Colosseum
* **Abstract:** DragonRadio is Drexel University's entry in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) competition. It is fully open source, and a pre-built image is available ready-to-run in the Colosseum. The first portion of this seminar will provide background on DragonRadio's architecture and operation, which will be sufficient to complete a provided lab exercise exploring DragonRadio's PHY and MAC layers. The second portion of the seminar will demonstrate how to use the tools included with DragonRadio to analyze and visualize data logged during Colosseum batch jobs.
