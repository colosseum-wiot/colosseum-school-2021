## Invited Speakers - Day 2


* **Speaker:** Geoffrey Mainland, Associate Professor of CCI at Drexel University
* **Title:** Using DragonRadio in the Colosseum
* **Abstract:** DragonRadio is Drexel University's entry in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) competition. It is fully open source, and a pre-built image is available ready-to-run in the Colosseum. The first portion of this seminar will provide background on DragonRadio's architecture and operation, which will be sufficient to complete a provided lab exercise exploring DragonRadio's PHY and MAC layers during the following hands-on period. The second portion of the seminar will demonstrate how to use the tools included with DragonRadio to analyze and visualize data logged during Colosseum batch jobs.
