## Invited Speakers - Day 1


* **Speaker:** [Tan Wong](https://wong.ece.ufl.edu/bio/), Professor of ECE at University of Florida
* **Title:** Building a flexible radio stack on Colosseum for spectrum sharing
* **Abstract:** Share experience in building a radio stack, from FPGA implementation to spectrum decision algorithm, and a set of Colosseum workflow tools that we employed in the recent DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2). The radio stack was primarily designed to achieve interference robustness and spectrum agility in a small-scale ad-hoc network. This design focus led our team to win the overall top prize at the SC2 Championship Event.
